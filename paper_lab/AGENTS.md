# Codex instructions — Paper Lab (existing production simulator)

This applies to `paper_lab/**`.

The file `worker.ts` is a **snapshot** of the existing independent Railway Function `k-signal-paper-monitor`. It is **not GitHub auto-deployed**. Its existing demo-free research-only logic, persistent state, protected dashboard and Telegram bot notifications must remain intact while Binance Demo is developed.

- **Never send real orders.** The Paper Lab remains `PAPER_ONLY`.
- Do not change live Paper Lab state, poller, user Telegram binding, credentials or mounted volume as part of Demo work. No restart or migration unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Existing target: net +1% TP after simulated entry/exit fees and slippage, existing stop logic, Telegram signal and performance reporting.
- A historical bug sent synthetic startup-test exits with undefined source IDs to Telegram; fixed with strict source checks and test-notification suppression. Retain these protections in all refactors.
- Existing baseline synthetic BDD: 152 scenarios at last confirmed deployment; verify actual Railway code and current status before claiming it still matches this snapshot.
- Read `../binance_demo/CODEX_HANDOFF.md` for the shared project and the separate Binance Demo service.
